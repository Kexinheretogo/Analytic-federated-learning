# Analytic-Federated-Learning
This repo will be continually updating analytic federated learning methods.
## Dummy data validation

Currently, we have released the dummy data validation code for the Analytic Federated Learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16240). You can use this code and implement it in your own research.

More detailed codes will be available later.
